### VARIANCE VIEWER - SETTINGS
# Lines starting with "#" are comments and will not be interpreted
#
## Global Settings for variance classification
# Each variance type can be defined as follows:
#
# ```
# :<name>[<type>|<color>]:
# <rules/settings>
# :<name>:
# ```
#
# <name>: Name to use for ones variance type
#			(Any Combination of letters, spaces and numbers)
# <type>: One of the following user definable variances:
#			MISSING (M): (sequence of) characters missing in one
#							word but present in the other
#							e.g. missing characters: x
#								changes: Testx | Test 
#								=> Missing Variance with the character x
#			DISTANCE (D): levenshtein distance on character basis
#							between two words (with min and max distance)
#							e.g. min distance:0, max distance:2
#								changes: Test | Text 
#								=> Distance Variance of one character
#			REPLACEMENT (R): Changes between words, where a sequence of
#							characters of one word are changed to another
#							sequence of characters in the other word
#							e.g. Replacement Rule: ae -> ä
#								changes: Bär | Baer
#								=> Replacement Variance with the changes
#									from ae to ä
#			SEPARATION (S): Changes between a sequence of words where the only
#							difference are their separation  
#							(with a max separation length)
#							e.g. max separations:3
#								changes: thistest | this test
#								=> Separation Variance with one separation between 
#									the words "this" and "test"
#
# <color>: In hex-code defined color to represent a variance type
#
# <rules/settings>: Variance specific rules and settings of the variances in <type>
#	MISSING (M): Character (sequences) separated by whitespaces
#	e.g. 
#		a b cd 
#		e f g
#					 
#	DISTANCE (D): Min and max distance value, separated by whitespace
#	e.g.
#		0 3
#
#	REPLACEMENT (R): A list of (bidirectional) replacement rules. 
#					Each rule is in one line and separates the replacement by a space
#	e.g.
#		ae a
#		ß ss
#
#	SEPARATION (S): Max separations 
#	e.g.
#		1
#
#

## TEI specific settings
# CSS for words with TEI attribute rend
# e.g. rend="wide" and css:'.wide{letter-spacing: 3px;}'
# Every word that is set to wide will be displayed with 
# letter spacing of 3px in the gui
:css:
.wide{letter-spacing: 3px;}
.sizeXL{font-size: x-large;}
.sizeXXL{font-size: xx-large;}
.straight{text-decoration: underline;}
.initial{text-decoration: underline;}
:css:

# TEI tags that contain content, should normaly not be changed
# Separated by spaces (Default: head p)
